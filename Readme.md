What's New In A Spec
====================

- [html5](./html5)
- [dom4](./dom4)
- [es5](./es5)
- [es6](./es6)
- [xhr2](./xhr2)

We list all new stuff that comes with more recent specifications, relative to
the previous version (whatever "version" means nowadays).

I will happily receive any request for changes if something is not up-to-date
or is inaccurate.  Please raise an issue on Github.  Ideally, I'd love you
to give me proof that what you say is true.
