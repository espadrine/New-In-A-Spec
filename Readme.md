We list all new stuff that comes with more recent specifications, relative to
the previous version (whatever "version" means nowadays).

I will happily receive any request for changes if something is not up-to-date
or is inaccurate.  Please raise an issue on Github.  Ideally, I'd love you
to give me proof that what you say is true.
